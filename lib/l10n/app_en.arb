In fact, doing so may violate federal civil rights laws. Under federal law, if you need emergency medical services, hospitals with emergency rooms must screen and treat you regardless of your immigration status, how much money you have, or whether you have insurance. Similarly, you can seek primary and preventive health care at community health centers regardless of your immigration status, your ability to pay, or whether you are insured.
