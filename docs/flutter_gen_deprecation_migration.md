# Flutter `flutter_gen` Deprecation Notice – What It Means and How to Migrate

## 🔔 Warning Message

When entering debug mode, you may see:

```
Synthetic package output (package:flutter_gen) is deprecated: https://flutter.dev/to/flutter-gen-deprecation. In a future release, synthetic-package will default to `false` and will later be removed entirely.
```

---

## ❓ What This Means

Flutter is deprecating the use of `flutter_gen` as a **synthetic package**, which currently allows you to import things like localization or assets using:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
```

In the future:
- This behavior will be **disabled by default**
- You will need to **migrate to the new file path system** (`lib/gen/...`)
- Eventually, `package:flutter_gen` will be removed entirely

---

## ✅ What You Should Do

### 1. Update `pubspec.yaml`

Opt out of the deprecated behavior by updating your `flutter` block:

```yaml
flutter:
  generate: true
  gen:
    synthetic-package: false
```

---

### 2. Update Import Paths

Search and replace all imports like:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
```

With:

```dart
import 'package:my_right_portal/gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
```

*(Ensure `my_right_portal` matches your actual project name.)*

---

### 3. Clean and Regenerate

After updating:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter gen-l10n
flutter pub get
```

This ensures the new files are properly generated and clean.

## 📌 Notes

- **This is only a warning for now.** You can continue building for the moment.
- **Do migrate soon**, before a future Flutter release makes `synthetic-package: false` the default.
- **Migrating now** helps avoid bugs or breakage later.

---

## ✅ Optional: Suppress the Warning

You can suppress the warning temporarily by updating your settings, but **migration is the best long-term solution**.
