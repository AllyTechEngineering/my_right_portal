# Synthetic Package Deprecation and Migration Guide for MyRightPortal Project

---

## What is `flutter_gen`?

`flutter_gen` was a **synthetic package** automatically created by Flutter to handle generated assets like localization, images, and fonts.

Example imports:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gen/assets.gen.dart';
```

---

## Why is Synthetic Package Output Deprecated?

Flutter is evolving its asset generation to improve:

- âœ… IDE support (better autocomplete, refactor support)
- âœ… Build system reliability (cleaner dependency resolution)
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility

Synthetic packages made builds slower and more fragile.  
Instead, Flutter now generates files **locally** under `.dart_tool/flutter_gen`.

---

## Migration Path

| Step | Status |
|:---|:---|
| Add `generate: true` in `pubspec.yaml` | âœ… Done |
| Confirm successful generation of assets and localization code | âœ… Done |
| Monitor future Flutter versions for removal of synthetic-package support | ðŸ”” Ongoing |

In your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  generate: true
```

You already completed this!

---

## Immediate Actions (Completed âœ…)

- [x] Added `generate: true` under `flutter:` section in `pubspec.yaml`
- [x] Verified code generation for assets and localization
- [x] Verified no broken references to `package:flutter_gen`

---

## Future Actions (To Monitor ðŸ””)

- [ ] Monitor Flutter release notes (post 3.29) for full removal of `synthetic-package`
- [ ] When removed:
  - [ ] Validate all imports and asset references
  - [ ] Update or refactor if any manual adjustments are needed
  - [ ] Fully test build and deployment

## Conclusion

âœ… MyRightPortal project is already compliant with the upcoming Flutter changes.  
âœ… No further action is needed immediately.  
ðŸ”” Stay updated with Flutter stable releases to ensure smooth migration.
